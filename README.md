# WP + React + WP REST API demo

Sample WordPress plugin using React and WP REST API.

Presented at [WordCamp Prague 2016](https://2016.prague.wordcamp.org/).


## How to use

 - Install [WP REST API (Version 2)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) plugin into your WordPress site (as of WP 4.4; REST API endpoints will probably be merged into WordPress core in 4.5)
 - Clone this repo into `wp-content/plugins`
 - Run `npm install`
 - Run `npm run build`
